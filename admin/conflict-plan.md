# Conflict Plan

## What will your group do when it encounters conflict?
We won't be nervous to over communicate so we can solve the conflict and move on quicker. 

## How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Before we start coding we can address house keeping topics like 'are comfortable with your contributions?' and 'are you sure?'.

Or we can say if we are at capacity with our current tasks, taking on more will lead to delays. 

## What is your process to resolve conflicts?
Avoid cowboy coding, and in any cases where we have a merge conflict, we will settle it like cowboys.

When we have a real issue, we will pull in the rest of the team to look at the merge conflict and come up with a resolution that will be most beneficial for the team in the future. 

## How and when will you escalate the conflict if your attempts are unsuccessful?
Ask a TA to come mediate and offer guidance to a solution. Otherwise, first to draw virtual blood in knife fight will have their code published.
