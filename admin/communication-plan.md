# Communication Plan

## How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
We plan on communicating 'after hours' via the slack channel.

## What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard?
1. we plan on not speaking over each other.
2. Making sure everyone is comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas. No thoughts are dumb thoughts.
3. Solicit help from the team while working together (which is most of the time)
4. Meet in the morning about any work conflicts, or new ideas about the project, any sort of original thoughts that we want to discuss. 

## How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
1. establish early on that everyone has good ideas and speak freely. 
2. get on the same page about the project vision so we communicate in similar terms.
