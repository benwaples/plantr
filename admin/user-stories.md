## Story # 1 -- plant selection
as a novice plant owner, I want to pick my plants via picture, not by name (because I don't know the name), so that I know how to take care of them and that I have picked the correct one.

## Story # 2 -- calendar
as a knowledgeable and busy plant owner, I want a schedule to see when I will need to take care of my plants, so that I dont have to think about it and can plan ahead easily.

## Story # 3 -- water today

## Story # 4 -- Collections
as a owner of many different plants, I want to be able to upload my own plants and assign appropriate care instruction so that I don't forget in the future.
